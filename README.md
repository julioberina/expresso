# Expresso

This is an Instagram-like site for coffee lovers. I'm a big coffee lover, and
Instagram is my social network of choice. I decided to create Expresso as one
of my portfolio projects to progress on my journey to employment.

Current technologies I'm learning at the moment:
* Ruby and Ruby on Rails
* React and Redux (maybe Mobx for smaller projects)
* Clojure(script) (my favorite language, currently using it for [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/))

Expresso will be deployed on Heroku (like any other Rails app), and will be
storing images in an S3 bucket. The Carrierwave gem will be responsible for the
transferring of the uploaded images from the app to the bucket.

All contributions are welcome, no matter how small or big.
